# ABB Pluto PLC Syntax

This extension enables basic syntax highlighting for **sps** and **fps** files used with the Pluto Manager software to program ABB Pluto Safety PLCs.
Using the Pluto Manager software is the best way to program these PLCs, but at times it can be handy to open the entire project in its raw text format. To do so one must first remove the password encryption from the project settings.

Please contact me if you have any request. If you are an ABB developer and would like to take over the development of this extension or simply claim the name, I will gladly hand it over.
